<p>The MERN stack is a powerful and popular set of technologies used to build full-stack web applications. It consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—each playing a crucial role in the development process. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Express.js is a lightweight web framework for Node.js that simplifies backend development and routing. React.js is a front-end library developed by Facebook, used to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution, allowing developers to use JavaScript throughout the entire stack. Together, these technologies offer a seamless development experience, enabling fast, scalable, and maintainable applications with a unified language across both client and server sides
